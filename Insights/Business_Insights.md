This report summarizes the key business insights derived from the analysis of **100,000 e-commerce transactions**. The objective is to translate data findings into actionable insights that support strategic and operational decision-making.

# Revenue Analysis:-
- The dataset reflects a high-volume transactional business model with revenue distributed across multiple **cities and payment methods**.
- A small percentage of high-value transactions contributes a disproportionately large share of total revenue, indicating a skewed revenue distribution.
- This pattern highlights the importance of identifying and retaining high-spending customers.

-----

# City-wise Performance:-
- Bangalore and Mumbai emerge as the top revenue-generating cities.
- Metro cities contribute significantly more to overall sales compared to non-metro regions.
- Higher average order values (AOV) in metro cities suggest stronger purchasing power and mature digital adoption.

Business Impact: Prioritizing metro regions can yield higher Return on Investment (ROI) on marketing and logistics investments.

# Payment Method Insights:-
- UPI is the most preferred payment method, demonstrating strong adoption of fast and convenient digital payments.
- Debit/Credit Cards and Net Banking show moderate usage.
- Cash-based payments account for a smaller share, indicating a clear shift toward a cashless ecosystem.

Business Impact: Digital-first payment strategies align well with current customer preferences.

# Transaction Status Analysis:-
- A majority of transactions are marked as Completed, reflecting a healthy transaction success rate.
- Cancelled and Failed transactions form a smaller but meaningful portion of total orders.
- Even a marginal reduction in cancellations can lead to a noticeable increase in realized revenue.

Business Impact: Optimizing checkout flow and payment reliability can directly improve revenue.

-----

# High-Value Transaction Insights:-
- Transactions above ₹3000 are classified as High-Value Transactions.
- Although limited in volume, these transactions contribute significantly to total revenue.
